<b>B   equal</b><br>
C   twice<br>
D   one forth<br>
<br>

Q2. Why Kelvin bridge is used for measurement of low resistance?<br> 

A   due to e.m.f source used<br>
B   due to a large current flow<br>
<b>C   due to contact and lead resistance</b><br>
D   due to power dissipation across the circuit<br>
<br>

Q3. What is the condition to achieve a high sensitivity in a Kelvin bridge?<br>

A   low voltage<br>
B   high power<br>
C   medium resistance<br>

B   capacitance only<br>
C   power and voltage<br>
D   current and frequency<br><br>


Q5. Why canâ€™t a Kelvin bridge be used for the measurement of low Quality factor value?<br>

A   due to thermoelectric effect<br>
<b>B   due to balance problem</b><br>
C   due to the dull detector used<br>
D   due to temperature<br>
<br>
